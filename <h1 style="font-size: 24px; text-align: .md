    <h1 style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center;">Navigating Open Source Code Security with Unclear Origins</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        When it comes to open source code, ensuring its security becomes tricky if its origins are murky. For instance, you might stumble upon a source code package on a website that doesn't provide much information about who actually wrote the code. There could be a README file inside the package that attributes the code to someone, but confirming whether this is legitimate becomes a tough task. Alternatively, you might clone code from a Git repository and assume that the person maintaining the repository is also the original author of the code. However, there's a possibility that the repository contains code from elsewhere that was merely copied. In such situations, verifying claims about who authored the code turns into a challenging mission.
